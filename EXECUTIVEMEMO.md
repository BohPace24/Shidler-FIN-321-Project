## Executive Summary 
This memo addresses the significant foreign exchange exposure faced by the U.S. Aerospace Manufacturer, stemming from a €20,000,000 receivable due in one year. The primary objective is to mitigate the risk of adverse currency movement, specifically a weakening Euro against the US Dollar (EUR/USD), which would directly reduce the expected USD cash flow. We propose analyzing three primary hedge families: Forwards, Money Market instruments, and Options to lock in a guaranteed minimum exchange rate or secure a definitive USD value, thereby ensuring budgetary certainty and protecting the firm's profit margin on this major contract. The immediate next step is to perform a detailed present value and scenario analysis on all three instruments to recommend the most cost effective and risk appropriate strategy by the end of the current quarter.

## Background & Objectives
The context of this analysis is the firm’s expected receipt of €20,000,000 in one year as payment for a recent aerospace component sale. As a U.S. entity reporting in USD, the firm faces a material foreign exchange risk exposure (long EUR, short USD) over the next 12 months. The core problem is that if the EUR/USD spot rate at maturity falls below the current forward rate of 1.0935, the actual amount of USD received will be less than the budgeted amount, thus eroding the profit margin. For example, if the rate drops to parity (1.0000), the firm would lose $1,870,000 compared to the hedged forward rate. The objective is to eliminate this downside risk and provide certainty regarding the final USD cash proceeds.

## Methods
To achieve cash flow certainty, we will analyze and evaluate three established hedge families for this long EUR exposure, each offering a different risk/reward profile. The first is a Forward Contract, which involves selling the €20,000,000 one year forward at the predetermined rate of 1.0935. The advantage is complete elimination of exchange rate risk, guaranteeing $21,870,000 in one year, but the disadvantage is forfeiting any potential upside if the Euro appreciates significantly. The second is a Money Market Hedge, a synthetic approach requiring the firm to borrow a calculated present value of EUR today at the 2.15% EUR interest rate, convert that EUR to USD at the current spot rate, and invest the USD at the 4.11% USD interest rate. The advantage is that this locks in a rate governed by the interest rate parity theorem, potentially offering a slight arbitrage or better rate than the bank's quoted forward, though it requires managing simultaneous debt and investment positions. The third strategy is using Options, specifically purchasing a Put Option on EUR with a strike of $1.1606 and a premium of $0.019 per contract. This acts as an insurance policy: the advantage is establishing a minimum floor for the USD proceeds (the $1.1606 strike) while allowing the firm to benefit from unlimited upside appreciation of the Euro. The disadvantage is the upfront cost of the premium, which is a sunk cost regardless of whether the option is exercised.

## Limitations & Next Steps
A key limitation is the reliance on the available forward quote (1.0935) and the credit risk associated with the counterparty in any forward contract. Furthermore, the Option prices provided (Put at $0.019 and Call at $0.024 for the $1.1606 strike) may not represent immediate executable market rates for the entire €20,000,000 quantity. The immediate next step is to calculate the precise final USD proceeds for the Money Market Hedge and compare the net guaranteed proceeds of all three methods after accounting for the interest rates and premiums.
